Choose the right authentication provider for your project.

<ELI5>
Authentication providers are like different security systems for your home. BetterAuth is DIY - you install and manage it yourself. Clerk is like a monitored security service - they handle everything, you pay monthly. Auth0 is the enterprise version with all the bells and whistles.
