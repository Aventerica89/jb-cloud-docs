Verify your project is ready for production before launching.

<ELI5>
This is like a pilot's pre-flight checklist. Before your website goes live, run through these items to catch problems that could affect real users. It's easier to fix issues now than after launch.

## Detailed Verification

### 1. Environment Variables

**Check production env vars are set:**

```bash
vercel env ls production
```

**Common variables to verify:**
- Database connection strings
- API keys (Stripe, OpenAI, etc.)
- Auth secrets
- Analytics IDs

**Warning signs:**
- Using `localhost` URLs in production
- Test/sandbox API keys in production
- Missing required variables

### 2. Domain Configuration

**Verify domain setup:**

```bash
vercel domains ls
```

**Check:**
- Primary domain resolves correctly
- www redirect configured (www -> apex or vice versa)
- Old domains redirected if migrating

### 3. Performance Audit

**Run Lighthouse locally:**

```bash
npx lighthouse https://your-domain.com --view
```

**Target scores:**
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Performance | > 80 |
| Accessibility | > 90 |
| Best Practices | > 90 |
| SEO | > 90 |

### 4. Security Review

**Check for exposed secrets:**

```bash
# Search for hardcoded keys
grep -r "sk_live\|sk_test\|api_key\|secret" src/
```

**Verify headers:**
- Content Security Policy
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options

### 5. Error Handling

**Test error scenarios:**
- 404 page renders correctly
- 500 errors show friendly message
- API errors return proper status codes
- Form validation errors display

### 6. Analytics & Monitoring

**Set up before launch:**
- [ ] Vercel Analytics enabled
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Uptime monitoring
- [ ] Log retention configured

## Pre-Launch Testing

### Functional Testing

1. **Test all user flows:**
   - Sign up / Login
   - Core features
   - Payment flows (if applicable)
   - Contact forms

2. **Test on multiple devices:**
   - Desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Mobile (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
   - Tablet

3. **Test edge cases:**
   - Empty states
   - Long text inputs
   - Slow network (use Chrome DevTools)

### Load Testing

For high-traffic launches:

```bash
# Simple load test with curl
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://your-domain.com &
done
```

Or use a proper load testing tool like k6 or Artillery.

## Launch Day

### Before Going Live

1. **Final preview deployment:**
   ```bash
   vercel
   # Test the preview URL thoroughly
   ```

2. **Deploy to production:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Verify production:**
   - Visit your domain
   - Test critical flows
   - Check logs for errors

### After Launch

1. **Monitor for 30 minutes:**
   - Watch error rates
   - Check response times
   - Monitor server logs

2. **Have rollback ready:**
   ```bash
   vercel rollback  # If issues arise
   ```

3. **Celebrate responsibly** - keep your laptop nearby.

## Using with Claude Code

Ask Claude to help verify:

> "Review my project for production readiness"

Claude will check environment variables, security issues, and common problems.

> "Run a pre-launch checklist for my Vercel project"

Claude will go through this checklist and report any issues.

> "Check if my site has any security vulnerabilities"

Claude will scan for common security issues like exposed secrets.
