## Dashboard Overview

<Mermaid title="Dashboard Data Flow">
{`flowchart LR
    subgraph Input["Data Sources"]
        Sites[WordPress Sites]
        Health[Health Checks]
        Updates[Update Status]
    end

    subgraph Processing["Processing"]
        Sync[Sync Service]
        Score[Health Scoring]
    end

    subgraph Display["Dashboard"]
        Cards[Summary Cards]
        Charts[Charts]
        Alerts[Attention List]
    end

    Sites --> Sync
    Health --> Sync
    Updates --> Sync
    Sync --> Score
    Score --> Cards
    Score --> Charts
    Score --> Alerts
`}
</Mermaid>

The dashboard provides at-a-glance status:

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Total Sites | Number of connected sites |
| Online | Sites responding to health checks |
| Offline | Sites not responding |
| Updates Available | Combined plugin + theme updates |

### Charts

- **Site Status**: Pie chart showing online/offline/unknown distribution
- **Pending Updates**: Bar chart showing plugin vs theme updates

### Health Scores

Sites are scored 0-100 based on:
- Online/offline status
- SSL certificate validity
- Number of pending updates
- Time since last health check

Sites with scores below 80 appear in the "Sites Needing Attention" section.

## Connecting a WordPress Site

<Mermaid title="Site Connection Options">
{`flowchart TD
    Start[Add New Site] --> Check{Host Type?}
    Check -->|Standard| AppPass[Application Passwords]
    Check -->|Restricted| Connector[WP Manager Connector]

    AppPass --> WP56[WordPress 5.6+]
    WP56 --> Profile[Users > Profile]
    Profile --> Create[Create App Password]
    Create --> Add[Add to WP Manager]

    Connector --> Upload[Upload Plugin]
    Upload --> Activate[Activate]
    Activate --> Secret[Set Secret Key]
    Secret --> Add
`}
</Mermaid>

### Option 1: Application Passwords (Standard)

For WordPress 5.6+ with standard REST API access:

1. Go to your WordPress site
2. Navigate to: **Users > Profile > Application Passwords**
3. Create a new application password
4. Add the site in WP Manager with the URL and credentials

### Option 2: WP Manager Connector Plugin

For hosts that block REST API (like xCloud.host) or have security plugins:

1. Upload `wp-manager-connector.php` via **Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin**
2. Activate the plugin
3. Go to **Settings > WP Manager** and set a secret key
4. In WP Manager, add your site using the secret key as the password

WP Manager automatically detects the connector plugin and uses it for syncing.
