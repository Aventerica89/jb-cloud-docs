WP Manager provides multiple ways to organize your WordPress sites beyond just servers and providers.

## Projects

Group sites by client, purpose, or any other criteria with color-coded projects.

<Mermaid title="Project Organization">
{`flowchart TD

        P1[Client A - Blue]
        P2[Personal Sites - Green]

        S3[Site 3]
        S4[Site 4]
