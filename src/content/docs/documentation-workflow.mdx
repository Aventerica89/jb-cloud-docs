import Mermaid from '../../components/Mermaid.astro';

This site is built differently from traditional documentation. Instead of writing docs after the fact, I document processes **as they happen** using Claude Code as my assistant.

## The Problem with Traditional Docs

We've all been there:
- Figure out how to do something complex
- Tell yourself "I'll document this later"
- Never document it
- Forget how you did it 6 months later
- Spend hours figuring it out again

## The Solution: Document While Doing

I keep Claude Code running in my terminal while I work. When I solve a problem or set something up, the conversation itself becomes the documentation.

### How It Works

<Mermaid title="Documentation Capture Flow">
{`sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant Claude as Claude Code
    participant Docs as Docs Site
    participant CF as Cloudflare

    You->>Claude: Share task/problem
    Claude->>You: Suggests solution
    You->>You: Test solution
    You->>Claude: Share results/errors
    Claude->>You: Refine solution
    You->>Claude: "Document this process"
    Claude->>Docs: Creates/updates MDX file
    Claude->>Docs: Git commit & push
    Docs->>CF: Webhook triggers deploy
    CF->>CF: Build & publish
`}
</Mermaid>

1. **Start working on a task** with Claude Code open
2. **Share what you're trying to do** - Claude helps you figure it out
3. **Encounter issues** - Paste errors, screenshots, console output
4. **Solve the problem together** - Claude suggests fixes, you test them
5. **Ask Claude to document it** - "Add this process to the docs"

The documentation is written while the context is fresh, including:
- The actual commands that worked
- Errors you encountered and how to fix them
- Why certain approaches were chosen over others

## Real Example: Updating OpenWebUI

Here's how the [Updating Docker Apps](/xcloud/updating-docker-apps/) guide was created:

**The situation:** xCloud support told me I needed to SSH into my server to update OpenWebUI, but I'd never done it before.

**The conversation:**
1. I asked Claude Code how to SSH update a Docker app
2. Claude asked clarifying questions (Docker or docker-compose? Do I have SSH access?)
3. We discovered I needed to set up SSH keys first
4. We hit permission errors - Docker commands didn't work via SSH
5. Found the xCloud Command Runner workaround
6. Successfully updated the app
7. Asked Claude to document the process

**The result:** A complete guide that includes:
- The SSH key setup process
- The xCloud-specific limitation about Docker permissions
- The exact commands that work
- Written in 5 minutes while everything was fresh

## What Gets Documented

Everything I figure out about:
- **xCloud** - Server management, Docker apps, SSH access
- **Cloudflare** - DNS, Pages, Workers, Tunnels
- **Supabase** - Self-hosted setup and configuration
- **Vercel** - Deployments and project config

If I spend more than 10 minutes figuring something out, it gets documented.

## The Workflow in Practice

```
Terminal 1: Claude Code session
Terminal 2: Actual work (SSH, commands, etc.)
Browser: Cloud dashboards, error lookups
```

When something works (or breaks interestingly), I switch to the Claude Code terminal and either:
- Paste the output/error
- Share a screenshot
- Describe what happened

Claude helps me understand it and writes it up.

## Benefits

### 1. Documentation Actually Gets Written
Because it happens during the work, not after, it actually gets done.

### 2. Errors Are Documented
Traditional docs skip the "what can go wrong" part. Real-time documentation captures the errors and fixes.

### 3. Context Is Preserved
Six months from now, I won't remember why I chose Cloudflare Workers over a different OAuth solution. The docs capture that reasoning.

### 4. It's Faster Than You Think
Asking "document this process we just did" takes seconds. Claude already has the context from helping you.

### 5. Searchable Knowledge Base
Everything ends up in a searchable docs site instead of scattered across notes, bookmarks, and memory.

## Getting Started

If you want to adopt this workflow:

1. **Set up a docs site** - See [Documentation Site Setup](/cloudflare/docs-site-setup/)

2. **Keep Claude Code open** while you work:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Sites/your-docs
   claude
   ```

3. **Work normally** - When you figure something out, share it with Claude

4. **End with documentation** - "Add a guide for what we just did to the docs"

5. **Review and publish** - Claude commits and pushes, Cloudflare auto-deploys

## This Very Document

Even this page was created using the workflow it describes. I asked Claude:

> "Create a document explaining how I'm using you to document everything I'm doing along the way"

And here we are.
