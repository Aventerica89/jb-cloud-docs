Clerk provides drop-in authentication with managed infrastructure.

<ELI5>
Clerk is like renting a fully-furnished apartment instead of building a house. You get a login system that works immediately - login forms, user profiles, team management - all ready to go. You pay monthly but save weeks of development time.
