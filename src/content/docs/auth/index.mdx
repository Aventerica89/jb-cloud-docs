Guide to choosing and implementing authentication.

<ELI5>
Authentication is how your app knows who's using it. When someone logs in, the app creates a "session" that remembers them. This guide helps you pick the right auth system and set it up correctly the first time.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | BetterAuth | Clerk |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **Type** | Self-hosted | Managed service |
| **Pricing** | Free (open source) | Free tier + paid |
| **Setup** | More code, full control | Less code, managed |
| **Database** | You provide | Clerk manages |
| **UI Components** | Build your own | Pre-built components |
| **Best for** | Full control, privacy | Quick setup, enterprise |

## Decision Guide

### Choose BetterAuth if:

- You want **full control** over your auth system
- You need to **keep data in your own database**
- You're comfortable writing **custom UI**
- You want to **avoid vendor lock-in**
- **Budget is tight** (it's free and open source)

### Choose Clerk if:

- You want **minimal setup time**
- You need **pre-built UI components**
- You want **managed infrastructure**
- You need **enterprise features** (SAML, SCIM)
- You're building a **B2B SaaS product**

## Common Auth Flows

### Email + Password

The classic login method. User provides email and password.

**BetterAuth:** Built-in, requires email verification setup
**Clerk:** Built-in with pre-built forms

### Social OAuth (Google, GitHub, etc.)

Let users login with existing accounts.

**BetterAuth:** Configure each provider manually
**Clerk:** Enable with a toggle in dashboard

### Magic Link

Passwordless login via email link.

**BetterAuth:** Available as plugin
**Clerk:** Built-in option

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Extra security with TOTP codes.

**BetterAuth:** Available as plugin
**Clerk:** Built-in option

## ELI5: How Auth Works

1. **User submits credentials** (email/password, OAuth, etc.)
2. **Server verifies** the credentials are correct
3. **Session created** - a token stored in a cookie
4. **Future requests** include the cookie to prove identity
5. **Session expires** after a timeout or logout

The difference between providers is mainly:
- Where the verification happens (your server vs their server)
- How sessions are stored (your database vs their service)
- What UI you use (your components vs their components)

## Security Basics

Regardless of provider, always:

- [ ] Use HTTPS (automatic on Vercel)
- [ ] Set secure cookie flags
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on login
- [ ] Hash passwords (providers handle this)
- [ ] Validate email addresses
- [ ] Log authentication events

## Using with Claude Code

> "Set up authentication for my Next.js app"

Claude will ask which provider you prefer, then set it up.

> "Add Google OAuth to my BetterAuth setup"

Claude will configure the provider and update your UI.

> "Protect my API routes with authentication"

Claude will add middleware to verify sessions.
