Skills are reusable Claude Code workflows for common tasks.

<ELI5>
Skills are like recipes for Claude Code. Instead of explaining what you want step-by-step, you invoke a skill and Claude knows exactly what to do. They encode best practices so you don't have to remember them.
</ELI5>

## What Are Skills?

Skills are defined in `~/.claude/commands/` and can be invoked with `/skill-name`:

```
/deploy-env vercel production
```

Claude executes the skill's workflow - checking prerequisites, running commands, and verifying results.

## Available Skills

### Deployment

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/deploy-env` | Deploy environment variables from 1Password to platforms |
| `/deploy` | Run deployment with pre-flight checks |

### Security

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/secrets-audit` | Scan codebase for hardcoded secrets |
| `/security-review` | Review code for security vulnerabilities |

### Development

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/build-fix` | Diagnose and fix build errors |
| `/tdd-workflow` | Test-driven development workflow |

### Documentation

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/update-docs` | Update documentation and codemaps |
| `/update-codemaps` | Refresh codebase documentation |

## Using Skills

### Direct Invocation

```
/skill-name [arguments]
```

Example:
```
/deploy-env vercel production
```

### Natural Language

You can also describe what you want:

> "Deploy my API keys to Vercel"

Claude will recognize this matches the `/deploy-env` skill and use it.

## Creating Custom Skills

Skills are markdown files in `~/.claude/commands/`:

```markdown
# deploy-env

Deploy environment variables from 1Password to a platform.

## Usage

/deploy-env <platform> <environment>

## Workflow

1. Scan .env.example for required variables
2. Check 1Password for matching keys
3. Deploy to specified platform
4. Verify deployment

## Platforms

- vercel
- cloudflare
- netlify
```

## Skill Best Practices

1. **Clear name** - Verb-noun format (`deploy-env`, `build-fix`)
2. **Defined workflow** - Step-by-step process
3. **Error handling** - What to do when things fail
4. **Verification** - Confirm the task completed

## Integration with This Documentation

Every documentation page includes "Using with Claude Code" sections showing:
- Example prompts that trigger the relevant skill
- What commands Claude will run
- What to expect

## Example Workflow

### Deploy Environment Variables

1. You say: `/deploy-env vercel production`

2. Claude:
   - Reads `.env.example` for required variables
   - Checks 1Password for matching keys
   - Runs `vercel env add` for each variable
   - Verifies deployment in Vercel dashboard

3. Result: All env vars deployed, ready to use

### Fix Build Errors

1. You say: `/build-fix`

2. Claude:
   - Runs `npm run build`
   - Analyzes error output
   - Identifies root cause
   - Applies fix
   - Verifies build succeeds

3. Result: Build passing, ready to deploy
