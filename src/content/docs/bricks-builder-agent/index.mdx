import Mermaid from '../../../components/Mermaid.astro';

An AI agent built on Claude Code that converts web design screenshots into valid, importable Bricks Builder JSON with AutomaticCSS (ACSS) variables and BEM-named global classes.

## Overview

The Bricks Builder Agent automates the tedious process of manually creating Bricks Builder elements. Given a screenshot of a web section, it:

1. Analyzes the layout structure and components
2. Generates valid Bricks Builder JSON
3. Applies ACSS variables for colors, spacing, typography
4. Creates BEM-named global classes following Frames methodology
5. Validates the output for import readiness

### Knowledge Base
Pre-built documentation covering Bricks Builder JSON structure, ACSS variables, responsive patterns, and element-specific guides.

### Pattern Library
Reusable JSON patterns for common sections: heroes, headers, card grids, galleries, footers.

### Validation Script
Checks JSON schema compliance, ID uniqueness, parent-child relationships, and global class cross-references.

### Learning System

    participant Learn as /learn Command
    participant Skills as ~/.claude/skills/learned/

    User->>Agent: Provide correction
    Agent->>Agent: Generate fixed JSON
    User->>Learn: Run /learn

    Learn->>Skills: Save pattern.md
    Learn->>Agent: Update GUIDELINES.md
    Note over Agent: Future generations use new patterns
`}
</Mermaid>

The agent learns from user corrections using the /learn command, extracting patterns and saving them as reusable skills.
